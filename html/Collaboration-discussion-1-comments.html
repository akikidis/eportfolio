                <p>Stephane Nappo once said, “It takes 20 years to build a reputation and few minutes of cyber-incident to ruin it”.
                <p>This is precisely what happened when a hacker with no trace installed a code on a Starwood Systems device and later managed to gain access to sensitive data on the company network system. When its alarm systems were triggered in September 2018, Marriott Hotels, which bought Starwood in 2014, learned the attacker had been able to harvest data from 339 million (7 million UK citizens) guest records, including names, email addresses, VIP status, and payment cards. Due to inadequate monitoring of account databases, failure of server hardening, and lack of effective encryption, Marriott was fined a staggering £18.4 million by the information commissioner's office (ICO).
                <p>In my opinion, the hacker's attempt to infiltrate the system was probably to retrieve government and military information to be used for malicious purposes or to sell this information on the dark web because Marriott is a large provider for government personnel. I can unequivocally state that Starwood's security infrastructure was poorly managed, and their security features were most likely outdated, allowing such attacks to occur.
                <p>On a personal note, this has been a learning curve that has led me to the realization that sometimes you need to see more than what is on the surface. Marriott for customers is simply a luxurious getaway, but from a cybersecurity standpoint, due to its luxurious state and class, we must consider that these are more vulnerable to attacks due to their VIP customers visiting. However, having the system be flawed for four years demonstrates that companies aren't aware enough that they can be vulnerable and that there is a need to increase their security regardless of how secure it is. Because attacks are unpredictable, what can we do to ensure that they can be avoided or reduced?
                <p>A customer or user of a business will always expect their data to be kept secure. If their data is stolen from a trusted business, then that trust is lost. This can lead to both financial losses due to fines and a loss in customers/users for the business due to the reputation damage caused by the data theft [2].
                <p>In 2016 Yahoo announced that a massive data breach had occurred in 2014, which affected 500 million users who had their data stolen [3]. This made it the largest data breach in history. Hackers had used forged cookies in order to bypass the login page on Yahoo sites [4]. A forged cookie is a HTTP cookie that has been created to impersonate a valid user without the designer requiring knowledge of the user’s password [5]. Further investigations into Yahoo’s cyber operations highlighted the use of out-of-date hashing algorithms and a lack of certificate updates on the site. These vulnerabilities could allow further hacks and allow an attacker to gain persistent presence [6].  
                <p>This breach led to a loss in trust from Yahoos customers and led to multiple lawsuits and fines, costing the company millions of pounds (est. £350million) [7]. The overall value of Yahoo dropped dramatically and led to renegotiations in the acquisition of the company.
                <p>The cost of implementing secure cyber security on a large business can be high but it will be cheaper than the cost of a data breach as highlighted by the case study of the Yahoo data breach. It is therefore extremely important that all businesses are aware of the importance of cyber security and take steps to mitigate the risk of cyber-attacks.

                <p>Cyber security affects everyone. There has been a huge shift in how data is stored and accessed. This shift from the physical world to the digital world leads to new threats. In this modern age, all businesses need to be aware of the risks of cyber-attacks and take steps to mitigate against them [1].

                <p>Using the internet has been become essential for many businesses in today’s world. It allows connectivity between the business, its customers and employees (Klaus & Elzweig, 2020). Central to this is remote access to the information stored in databases and it is here that companies have an obligation to prevent unauthorised access to this potentially sensitive data. Whilst the consequences on stock market price of a data breach for a company can vary depending on sector, (Morse et al., 2011) there is always a price to pay whether that is financial, reputational or legal. According to IBM Security (2022), the average cost of a data breach was USD 4.45 million rising to USD 4.82 million for those organisations involved in critical infrastructure.

                <p>Equifax, is one of the three major credit reference agencies in the USA. In 2017, it was allegedly hacked by the Chinese military and four individuals have subsequently been indicted for the hack (FBI, 2020). The hackers gained access by exploiting a vulnerability in Apache’s Struts 2 software (Wang & Johnson, 2018). The hackers subsequently accessed the sensitive information of 147.9 million American (Fruhlinger, 2020), 15.2 million UK (McCrank, 2017) and more than 20,000 Canadian (The Canadian Press, 2017) citizens including, names, social security numbers, birth dates, addresses, driving licence numbers and in some instances, credit card details. As of February 2020, this data breach has cost Equifax nearly USD 2 billion (Meltzer, 2020).

                        <p>Dear Nabil Abdul Hamid,
                        <p>Following you recent post concerning the cyber security attack in Marriot hotel, I have to admit, that I am really concerned about the method that was used during a few of these attacks. According to Madeline Ganfike, the Marriot hotel has been hacked at least 7 times since 2010[1]. One of the techniques used by the hackers is the social engineering method[2]. Social engineering refers to the methods and techniques that the hackers use to expose the weaknesses of the human factor to gain their trust and then manipulate them to reveal sensitive information from them. These techniques vary from sending faulty links that include malwares which allow them to access the system of the victims, but it can also be a combination of social interactions and technological exploits with the victims[3].
                        <p>The data breach at the Marriot hotel in March 2020, exposed the sensitive information of 5.2 million guests of the hotel. In the first three quarters of 2021, Marion hotel has spent over than 16 milion dollars to recover their hacked data. In May 2022, the hackers acquired about 20 GB of sensitive information including the CVV of the credit cards of the flyings crew and other VIP guests of a hotel located near Baltimor BWI airport. In this case, the attackers pretend to be from the technical support department of the hotel and convinced the personnel either by clicking on a phishing link, or by revealing his credentials over the phone or by using a remote desktop connection, the achieved to have full access to the system of the hotel.
                        <p>There a few ways to deal with the social engineering attacks. The organisations need to apply a combination of continuous training to their employees, apply the right policy within their organisation and finally use the appropriate technology such as automated defenses and tools that can detects and prevent those types of attacks[4].

                        <p> Dear Amy,
                        <p>I would like to add some further information based on your investigation about the forged cookie attacks. The cyber attacks that manipulate or forge HTTP cookies are described as cookie poisoning attacks. These attacks aim to hijack the sessions used by the end users and expose their sensitive information or take over control of their accounts.
                        <p>The cookies can be easily identified and possibly modified by using the developer tool panel of a web browser. A common example is the developer tool in google Chrome that is accessible by pressing F12 button on our keyboard. The easiest way to understand if the sensitive cookies such as the session cookies can be modified is, if the additional flag “httpOnly” is missing. The hackers, are able in this case to read and modify the cookies using Javascript and the “document.cookie” property and malicious scripts.
                         <p>There are three types of cookie based session attacks: The session hijacking attacks means that the attacker takes over the control of a particular session when the victim is connected to a specific site provided that he has knowledge of the current session cookie. The second session attack is the session spoofing which follows the same methodology like the session hijacking but the attackers use forged session or stolen cookies when the user is not connected. Finally, the session fixation attack tricks the user to login to an insecure site by using for example phishing emails or messages.
                         <p>In addition to the https links, secure wifi, antivirus and VPNs that were descibed by Stela, the access to a site can be also be considered secure if there is the “httpOnly” flag which will make the access to the scripts impossible, the usage of unique and secure session cookies will reduce the event of brute force attacks and finally using a cookie per single task will also reduce the risks of attacks.[1]

                        <p>Dear Steve,
                        <p>Based on you very interesting recent post concerning the hacking incident on the Apache strut software used by Equifax in 2017, I would like to add that the human factor played an important role to allow this attack to be successful. More specifically, on March 7,2017, the Apache software foundation announced that a few versions of its apache strut software had a vulnerability that could allow a possible remote attack on a targeted web application. It was reported that customers in Argentina tried to access their web portal using the insecure credentials (Admin/Admin). According to the article, Apache, has offered to its customers a security patch with clear instructions on how to deal with this vulnerability. Equifax, decided to ignore the warnings and to not proceed with the update of their apache software struts with the latest released patch.[1]
                        <p>As a consequence, the data breach took place two months later by 4 Chinese hackers. The data breach was not easily detected because the hackers store the large data files into compressed and small size files. Afterwards, they deleted the compressed files which helped them to show minimum trails during that operation. The fact that they had managed to access the Equifax network, helped them to use the credit firm secure communication channels. Equifax has communicated this incident to its customers 6 weeks later. The impact was huge for the reputation of Equifax that suffered also huge financial losses. However, the one that were mostly affected were the 147.9 million people (almost half of the US population) whose confidential data such as their social security numbers had been exposed. The US-China relationships had also been affected. These two facts, the lack of response by Equifax personnel to the announcement of Apache and the decision to not perform the recommended updates by Apache is a indication that the human factor is an important element of the Cyber security.[2]
