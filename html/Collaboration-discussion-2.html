                        <p><b>Blockchain.</b>
                        <p>Nowadays, every company is searching for security technologies to secure their online transactions. The digital economy relies on third parties trusted authorities which can prove that a certain transaction is authorised, trustworthy and valid. But third party authorities can be manipulated and hacked and this is where the blockchain comes to provide distributed consensus and anonymity for every online transaction. The blockchain is identified as the distribution of transactions over a network among the participating parties. The majority of the participants should verify every transaction in the public ledger by a common consent. The best example that uses the blockchain is the Bitcoin which uses a cryptographic proof instead of a third party trust to verify that an online transaction (that is protected by a digital signature) can be executed between two parties. [2] 
                        <p><b>Blockchain advantages and disadvantages.</b>
                        <p>The advantages of blockchain are the decentralisation, the low cost for the users and the network distribution. The decentralisation provides less time to validate a transaction because nobody else has to act as an intermediate to authenticate it. The absence of intermediates allows also the users to execute their transaction faster and with less costs. Finally, the fact that the same information are well distributed within the network make it resistant and resilient to any failures. However, there are some disadvantages of the blockchain such as the high cost for the companies to use this technology. In addition, it is inefficient to occupy multiple users even though only one will receive the transaction and this also consumes a lot of energy. Furthermore, the private keys are unique and they cannot be recovered if they are lost. Finally, the increasing storage to perform these transactions and the potential unemployment that might occur are also drawbacks of the blockchain security technology. [3]
                        <p><b>IoT.</b>
                        <p>The Internet of Things(IoT) is another important security technology. The IoT can be defined as connected devices that can communicate and share their data over a network. The connected devices include not only the computers but network connected devices such as cars smartphones, electronic appliances, toys, cameras, medical instruments, humans, farm animals, etc, that are communicating with each other and share information based on some protocols.[4][6] 
                        <p><b>IoT advantages and disadvantages.</b>
                        <p>The advantages of IoT include the improved security via the smart devices, the automation of activities which reduces significantly the time to perform a task, the easy access to information from everywhere and the good management of the IoT can reduce the energy consumption of smart devices. IoT can also be used for medical assistance, such as in the event of detecting an accident,  immediately inform emergency services or they can assistance the medical staff to take decision for the patients based on the smart connected devices. Finally, the tracking of objects, assets, inventory, orders and customer management can be better achieved by using IoT.         On the other side, there are some disadvantages of the IoT such as the unauthorised access in a system which can cause the misuse of our data. Also, IoT highly rely to the internet access and the complexity of the systems can easily cause a failure. Moreover, the high dependency that people have to the IoT tends to create laziness, less educated and less creative people. Lastly, the unskilled people are in risk of loosing their job due to the rapid increase of IoT devices. [5]

                        <p><b>Blockchain advantages.</b>
                        <p>Blockchain is one of the latest innovative security technologies. More and more enterprises are interested in blockchain technology. According to the initial observations and the comments in the discussion, the blockchain as a security technology offers a lot of advantages such as data protection, network distribution, decentralisation, confidentiality, autonomy, fault-tolerance, integrity, verification, immutability, resilience, faster and low-cost transactions, anonymity and the absence of a third party to provide authentication which provides high quality of data technology. [1]   
                        <p><b>Blockchain disadvantages, alternatives and risks. </b>
                        <p>On the contrary, as per the discussion, the blockchain has a lot of issues such the high energy consummation, the issue to recover the unique key, the inefficiency of occupying multiple users to verify a transaction and the issues related to the absence of regulations which leads to an increased number of crimes using cryptocurrencies. It is worth it to mention that the blockchain transactions are visible in the public ledger providing traceability while only the senders and receivers remain anonymous. 
                        <p>Moreno is an alternative to the bitcoin which resolves the traceability issue of the bitcoin transactions because it keeps the transactions anonymous as well as the identity of the senders and the receivers. 
                        <p>As per the risks, the absence of regulations means that every company must spend more to create their own private blockchain for privacy concerns. The customers that would like to use blockchain should use secure foundations to create their blockchain based on business requirements and should develop a risk model otherwise their data security flows are in risk to be revealed.
                        <p><b>Limitations of IoT as security technology and improvements.</b>
                        <p>Following the observations in the discussion, IoT offers some security features such as remote control of home appliances, industrial, medical equipment and it also provides smart security, but as it stands as a platform, it does not meet the criteria to be considered as a security technology and it miss the foundations to be considered as a security technology as it was initially mentioned based on the reference from hktrainings.com. Even though, it uses some certain protocols to secure the interconnected devices, the IoT are vulnerable to attacks. The group of methods, strategies, and resources define the IoT security which can act as the technology to secure the Internet of Things devices. It was highlighted that the IoT can be used with a blockchain to transmit data over private blockchain networks by providing secure transmissions of the shared transactions. It was also mentioned that the IoT firewalls can improve the security of IoT by centralising all the devices and the usage of IPS to prevent attacks on their IoT devices. It has also been spotted that some IoT devices provide unauthorised access which can be improved by changing the default passwords of the IoT, block specific ports of the smart devices, use HTTPS instead of HTTP and add some scripts that would limit the functionalities of SMTP and FTP. An additional method to secure the IoT is the a dual authentication model which meets the requirement of the CIA (confidentiality, Integrity and Availability) as well as the Trust between the nodes and Authenticity.
