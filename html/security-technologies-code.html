            <h3>Decription of Assignment</h3>
            <b>Security technologies coding exercice</b>
                    
                    
            <p><b>Assignment Brief</b></p>
            You are now required to implement a Python code of a solution to the issue described in Unit 9.  This could be one of the solutions you recommended in your report submission in Unit 9 or one you did not consider in that submission. The cyber security approaches you have chosen should be clearly highlighted. So your proposed solution could involve the implementation of Multi-factor Authentication and the use of encryption technologies to store user data. You are not expected to implement solutions that involve the use of external devices, such as biometric devices. Ensure you consider the feedback you have received on your Unit 9 submission and in your formative programming outline submission.
            
            <p><b>Submission Guidance</b>
            <p>Your work can be carried out in the Codio Jupyter Notebook workspace, but final submission should be placed here only.</p>
            
            <p><b>Submission checklist:</b>
            
            <p>You should submit a fully tested set of code with all required libraries. Code should be well documented with in-line commentary.
            You should supply evidence of execution, demonstrating how key aspects of your code work (via demos, screenshots and output captures).
            You should submit a README file that documents how the application runs.
            File Submission:</p>
            
            <p>The source code and applicable documentation (including. comments explaining the code). Good programming principles should be applied throughout the code.
            Output from testing tools and suites.
            A README file containing a description of the solution implemented, and instructions on how to execute the code.
            Assignment Guidance
            You will receive marks for unsuccessful answers if they build a logical argument.  The deliverables for this assignment and the associated grading criteria (to be reviewed alongside the criteria grid in the Module Resources page) are:</p>
            
            
            <p>Python code, covering,Code elegance â€“ is the appropriate approach (techniques, algorithms etc) used? and
            Meeting your chosen solution requirements (Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 30%)
            Application of object-oriented programming features and
            Test data used to test the code. (Application of Knowledge and understanding weighted a 30%)
            Structure and Presentation (weighted at 30%) focuses on
            comments on the code explaining it,
            your README file containing a description of the solution implemented and instructions on how to execute the code (600 words), and
            how well you have organised your code
            Please note that academic integrity also applies to codes, where all sources can be placed in the README file and/or as part of the code commentary. (Academic Integrity weighted at 10%)</p>
            
            <p><b>Learning Outcomes</b></p>
            <p>Evaluate critically the solutions developed to solve/mitigate security issues</p>
