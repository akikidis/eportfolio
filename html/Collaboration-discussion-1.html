                    <p>In a continuous advancing world, companies invest a significant amount of money in cyber security to protect their sensitive and confidential data. The medium and large companies tend to spend more budget compared to the small companies and the charities. The major reasons that the companies invest in cybersecurity are: to protect their cash, their trade secrets, their intellectual property and ensure that there will be a business continuity as well maintain a higher level of fraud protection and comply with the regulations and laws[1]. Following the introduction of GDPR, it has been observed that the main concern of the companies has been shifted to protect the confidential data of their customer.
                    <p>However, there are some exceptions to this rule. Huawei, during the last decade did not respect the GDPR rule (see articles 5-11 and 44-50 of GDPR regulations)[2] and it demanded unconditional full access to confidential and sensitive data in China while at the same time in Europe it did not respect or it is possible that it violated intentionally major security rules on their supplied software and equipments. As a result they were banned in various countries including the United Kingdom, the United States, Australian and New Zealand while at the same time many countries in the European Union have imposed to Huawei various restrictions and they obliged the company to meet some standards in order to be allowed to use their services and softwares within their territory[3]. In addition, Huawei has lost the trust of its customers in the western countries and its sales were highly affected by the bans and the restriction. Huawei, would have been today one of the competitive leaders in the telecommunication market instead of struggling today to keep their place on it.

                    <p>Cyber security is considered as an important element for every company especially for the large enterprises which consume a generous budget to secure their capital, their reputation and lately they tend to invest a lot in the CIA triangle elements (confidentiality, integrity, availability) to secure the sensitive data of their customers. During my initial post, it was highlighted that HUAWEI violated the confidentiality (one of the main aspects of the CIA triangle) and the sensitive information of its customers. This incident has caused a big damage to the image and the reputation of the telecommunication firm because it created potilical issues with the US(for example the ban imposed in 2019 by D. Trump government) and conflicts with other huge firms such as ARM and Google. The impact in their revenues can be easily observed by comparing the sales of HUAWEI in US, UK and Europe before the ban and after the ban. 
                    <p>The latest incident was one of the highlights of violating of the confidential data of the consumers. From the discussion, the introduction of the GDPR in EU and the data protection act in the UK has increased the consumers awareness concerning their data protections. It was also highlighted in the discussion, that it seems to be a crucial point for the companies which will either invest in cybersecurity and increase their revenues, improve their reputation and turn away the negative comments from the press or they will have to take the risk especially the SME and that might harm their reputation and turn their customers away.  
                    <p>An important aspect in improving the cyber security is the continuous training of the employees of each company that should cover fundamental functionalities starting from the early stages of the project lifecycle. This means that every company should invest in cyber security and hire developers that are not only aware of the cyber security terms, but they should also have a critical ability and can apply the cybersecurity aspects in real time situations. The development team should be involved actively during the design of the product which should be a prerequisite to minimise cyber threats. Secondly, the continuous training of every member of the companies is really important to avoid accidental data breaches. Finally, as per the discussion, the end customers should be aware of the GDPR  aspects and think before acting while searching and buying a product.
